ðŸš€ SIRINADA: Regional Innovation Research Information System ðŸš€

During my internship at BAPPEDA Kota Banjarbaru in 2023, my team and I developed SIRINADA (Regional Innovation Research Information System) using CodeIgniter4. This system is designed to collect innovation and research data from various agencies across the city of Banjarbaru and assist BAPPEDA in monitoring development and innovations within the city.

Key features of the project include:

Data Collection for Innovations and Research: Integrating information on innovations and research from multiple agencies, ensuring well-organized data.
Monitoring Development and Innovations: Assisting BAPPEDA in tracking and evaluating development projects and innovations in Banjarbaru.
Development with CodeIgniter4: Utilizing the CodeIgniter4 framework to build an efficient and scalable system.
Team Collaboration: Working in a team of three, ensuring smooth project development and alignment with requirements.
This project enhanced my skills in system development, project management, CodeIgniter4, and team collaboration.
